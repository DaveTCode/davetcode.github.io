I also spend my day job mentoring (and even occasionally writing) C#. This project combines those two areas of interest and asks the question: &amp;ldquo;Is it possible to recompile 8080 assembly into CLR IL&amp;rdquo;
Did it work? Yes! I have successfully built a fully functional Space Invaders emulator with the 8080 cpu core purely implemented in IL.
This blog post covers some of the details of what 8080 assembly looks like, what IL looks like, the process of mapping one to the other and also a fair bit of details about the complications involved.</description></item></channel></rss>
